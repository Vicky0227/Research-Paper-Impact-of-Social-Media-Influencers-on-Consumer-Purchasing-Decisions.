📘 Research Project: Impact of Social Media Influencers on Consumer Purchasing Decisions
(Based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model — ELM)
🧠 Overview

This research project explores how social media influencers shape consumer purchasing decisions in India through the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) — a psychological framework explaining how persuasion works via central and peripheral routes.

The study investigates how trust, emotional appeal, and engagement across popular social platforms (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) influence consumer intent and decision-making patterns.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze the impact of influencer marketing on consumer purchasing behavior.

To assess the effectiveness of emotional vs. rational appeals in influencing consumer decisions.

To identify which social media platforms have the strongest impact on consumer trust and engagement.

To validate findings using quantitative analysis under the Elaboration Likelihood Model framework.

📊 Research Methodology

Approach: Quantitative Research

Sample Size: 60+ respondents from diverse demographic backgrounds in India

🔍 Key Findings

Influencer Trust emerged as the most significant factor influencing purchasing decisions.

Emotional appeal and authentic content drive stronger consumer engagement compared to purely promotional messaging.

Instagram was found to have the highest persuasive influence among surveyed platforms, followed by YouTube and Facebook.

The Peripheral Route (influencer attractiveness, credibility, and social proof) plays a major role in shaping quick purchase decisions, while the Central Route (information quality and message relevance) supports more deliberate decision-making.
